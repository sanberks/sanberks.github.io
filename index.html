      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've recently graduated from MSc Electrical and Electronics Engineering at EPFL, specializing in Data Science and Systems.
        My research interests lie in generative models, optimization, speech enhancement and reinforcement learning, especially in developing efficient algorithms that push the boundaries of intelligent systems.
        I previously studied at Bogazici University with a strong focus on signal processing and computer engineering.
